    <h2>
        <center>Project Abstract</center>
    </h2>
    <p>We had planned to create a fully electronic instrument based on the traditional Japanese 太鼓 or Taiko drum. The full instrument had plans to implement both complex hardware and software, using 2 Arduino Unos as well as a Raspberry Pi 3B, and fetching from an online database. The instrument was planned to detect a hit from a piezo sensor, send that data to a Raspberry pi, and the Pi would output audio from a database. We also planned to have a foam head over the wooden one to reduce vibration and possible accidental hits</p>

    <h2>
        <center>Summary of Project</center>
    </h2>
    <p>The project greatly deviated from the original plan we had after we encountered both hardware and software issues. Firstly was the Raspberry Pi, where it was based on the ARM64 CPU architecture. This architecture is unable to run the modern software and operating systems that we would have needed. After struggling with it, we eventually decided to as opposed to using a Raspberry Pi, to just have a Chromebook connect to the Arduinos and be running the software. The next problems that we would encounter would be in the Arduino Unos that we used. Firstly, our Piezos run on analog channels, meaning we're limited to only 6 per board, as opposed to the 13 lanes we initally thought we had. To counteract this, we had to drop certain features in favor of not adding a third Arduino. The second issue came in the functionality of the Arduinos, as they only could interact with the serial port of our computer, as opposed to the HID device it needed to be. To fix this, we used experimental software to flash the Arduino's memory with a different firmware which allowed it to interface with the computer. If I had to do the project again, I would wish for more functional sensors and less jankiness in our solutions. </p>
