    <h1>About Me
    </h1>
    <p>
        Hey there! My name is Noah, and I go by Ploverums online. I'm an ameteur web developer who is so bad at his job I've never legitimately completed a project. Currently I'm trying to learn how to use anime.js, as I think that putting fancy animations on my sites will make them look a lot more impressive than they actually are. I'm a speedrunner and a SRC moderator on Google Snake Game (damn you CLT) and Cookie Clicker as well. I have literally no credentials other than that I work a part time IT job at a temple. This site is going to reflect stuff I actually get done in the future, so it's useless for now. Anyways, seeya.

        Also screw dynamic web editors.
