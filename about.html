    <h1>About Me
    </h1>
    <p>
        Hey there! My name is Noah, and I go by Ploverums online. I'm an ameteur web developer who bites off more than he can chew. I try to get a lot done outside of my skill level, and it helps me out later on. Currently I'm trying to learn how to use anime.js, as I think that putting animations on my sites will make them look a lot more impressive than they actually are. I'm a speedrunner and a SRC moderator on a variety of web games, which have helped me grasp how things like HTML and JS work. I don't have many credentials or projects to show for my work right now, but they'll be coming soon. This site is going to reflect stuff I actually get done in the future, but for now, there's not a ton to see on it. If you want to contact me, look below, that'll be all! Seeya.
