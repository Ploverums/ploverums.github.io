        <p style="font-size: 39px;">So yeah, this is a thing? I was suprised when I found out it existed as well. Now I'm a part of it. I run the wiki and moderate the SRC board. Currently I'm also working on a project with Yarmi to create custom boards. CLT just added new sizes so that cuts down our workflow, all we have now is custom themes. I'm still in disbelief we got cheese mode created from the joke of burger mode. CLT just didn't do his job for 2 years and then comes back to literally fix all of our issues and add more stuff, it's insane. I love the guy but jeez, tell us before you're going to update so we can prepare the boards. That's all for now I guess. Just wanted to rant about snake. </p>
