    <h1><center>Reflection</center></h1>
    <p><center>For this project, I modeled the Maxdo Centre and Jinmao Tower, both located in Shanghai. While modeling both of these, I was faced with difficulty when going past the basic geometry of the buildings. Things such as the windows faced great issue, as with the staggered design of the floors of both of these building you'd have to create tons of different sets of windows. This process was extremely tedious and took multiple days to fully complete. The next issue I faced was with the scale of the building, as I had made it too tiny in comparison to the other buildings in my group. To resolve this, I had to individually scale every part and make small adjustments so they'd fit correctly. Onshape's primary issue was that there wasn't an option to scale an entire part studio. The final issue I faced was the lack of information on some of the buildings.  For some of the measurements I had to eyeball it. At the end of the day, I think my project could have been better.</center></p>
